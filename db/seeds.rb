# This file should ensure the existence of records required to run the application in every environment (production,
# development, test). The code here should be idempotent so that it can be executed at any point in every environment.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Example:
#
#   ["Action", "Comedy", "Drama", "Horror"].each do |genre_name|
#     MovieGenre.find_or_create_by!(name: genre_name)
#   end

require 'faker'

# Clear existing data
Restaurant.destroy_all

# Categories
categories = ["chinese", "italian", "japanese", "french", "belgian"]

# Seed 5 restaurants
5.times do
  restaurant_params = {
    name: Faker::Restaurant.name,
    address: Faker::Address.street_address,
    phone_number: Faker::PhoneNumber.phone_number,
    category: categories.sample
  }

  Restaurant.create(restaurant_params)
